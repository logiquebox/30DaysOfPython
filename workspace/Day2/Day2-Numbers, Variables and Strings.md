# Day 2 - Numbers, Variables and Strings 
This is meant to show the concepts of Numbers, Variables and Strings in Python 

## Numbers 
Numbers in python are categorised into three classes;
- Integers
- float
- Complex

### Integers 
Integers in python are positive or negative whole numbers without a trailing fraction.
`int()`

### Float 
Float in python are positive or negative whole numbers with a fraction
`float()`

### Complex numbers

`complex()`

## Math Operations Using Numbers 

### Addition 
`10 + 10`
### Multiplication 
`10 * 10`
### Division 
`10 / 10`
### Exponent
`10 ** 2` 
### Modular remainder
