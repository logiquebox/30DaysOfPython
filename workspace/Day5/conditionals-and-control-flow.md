# Day 5 - Conditionals and Control Flow 
 Conditional and control flow statements are used for decision making in programming; such that if a condition is met, a decision should be executed else another decision should proceed.

In Python, there are six different conditional statement 
1. If statement

2. If else statement

3. Nested if statement

4. Ifâ€¦Elif ladder

5. Short Hand if statement

6. Short Hand if-else statement

### If Statement 
The `if` statement is used to execute a program only if the condition is met

```Python 
# Example of IF Statement
num = 1
if num > 0:
    print(num, "is a positive number")
# when executed the output is
"1 is a positive number"
```

### If else Statement 
The `if else` statement is used to execute a program in both directions i.e whether the condition is met or not 

```Python 
# Example of IF else Statement
num = -1
if num < 0:
    print(num, "is a positive number")
else:
    print(num, "is a negative number")
# when executed the output is
"-1 is a negative number"
```
